## Overview of the statistical analysis:
In this analysis, we analyzed NYC Citibike data to determine if we can open a similar bike share business in Des Moines, Iowa. We are displaying NYC data and proposing how it can also work in Des Moines, Iowa. 

In this challenge, we accomplished the following:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Results:
### Here is what we came up with using visualizations in Tableau:
The description for each visual is below the image.

![checkout times](https://github.com/alyssamaestringer/bikesharing/blob/b82ac2c9b516f64918f99c27368cd8d9764f0ba5/Checkout%20Times.png)
#### Average trip duration is between 5-6 minutes. This data tells us that customers are utilizing the bike-sharing service for quick trips around the city.


![checkout times by gender](https://github.com/alyssamaestringer/bikesharing/blob/b82ac2c9b516f64918f99c27368cd8d9764f0ba5/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)
#### When we break down by gender, we see that each follow a similar average trip duration pattern. However, those that identify as female are more likely to have a longer trip by a minute or two compared to those who identify as male. Those who are listed as "unknown" have a range of 8-20 min peak trip duration.


![trips by weekday](https://github.com/alyssamaestringer/bikesharing/blob/b82ac2c9b516f64918f99c27368cd8d9764f0ba5/Trips%20by%20Weekday.png)
#### The most popular times for riding are on weekday evenings and weekends. If we take a closer look, we can see a common pattern in the data. Not only are weekday evenings popular but there is some popularity on weekday mornings as well, between 8-9am. This tells us that most bike riders that use the bike share during the week are most likely utilizing it to get to and from work. Bike usage is also popular pretty much all day Saturday, telling us bike riders utilizing the service on Saturdays are most likely using for leisure. 


![trips by weekday and gender](https://github.com/alyssamaestringer/bikesharing/blob/b82ac2c9b516f64918f99c27368cd8d9764f0ba5/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
#### Popular ride times seem to be consistent across genders. Although, those who identify as male have documented more trips so popular times are easier to spot. 

![trips by gender and user type](https://github.com/alyssamaestringer/bikesharing/blob/b82ac2c9b516f64918f99c27368cd8d9764f0ba5/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)
#### There are a lot more subscribers than customers, specifically with males. The most popular dys of the week for non-subscribers are Thursday-Sunday. It's almost opposite for subcribers, weekdays are more popular than weekends for subcribers. This is probably because subscribers are using bikes consistently to get to their weekly activities (to and from work) vs customers are using for leisure on the weekends.

![customer type](https://github.com/alyssamaestringer/bikesharing/blob/b82ac2c9b516f64918f99c27368cd8d9764f0ba5/Customer%20Type.png)
#### There are a lot more users who are subscribers than customers. This is great data, showing us that those who become Citibike customers are more likely to convert to a subscriber.


![starting and ending](https://github.com/alyssamaestringer/bikesharing/blob/b82ac2c9b516f64918f99c27368cd8d9764f0ba5/Starting%20and%20ending%20locations.png)
#### Starting and ending locations share the same popularity. When we compare this to trip duration, we know that customers are utilizing the bike sharing service for shorter trips within the city. 

## Summary:

In conclusion, opening a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa can be very successful for people who want an easier way to commute to work on the week days, and for leisure activity on the weekends. The data also shows that bike-sharing customers are very likely to become subscribers, giving us security in the success of the business. Des Moines, Iowa is not as concentrated as NYC so average trip duration could be higher in Des Moines. 

For future analysis I would want to get data on the amount of people who have a 5-10 minute bike commute to work, to get an idea of how many people are likely to use the service. 

### Two additional visualizations that can be made for future analysis:
1. Plot the top 20 offices in Des Moines and average commute times
2. Plot average age for bike-sharing users and compare with average ages in Des Moines, Iowa
